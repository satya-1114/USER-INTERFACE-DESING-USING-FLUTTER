AIM: To write and execute a simple Dart program to understand the basic syntax, variables, input/output, and operators in Dart.
DESCRIPTION:
Dart is an open-source, object-oriented programming language developed by Google.
It is used to build mobile, web, and desktop apps — mainly with Flutter.
Dart uses a simple syntax similar to C, Java, or JavaScript.
Key features:
•	Strongly typed language
•	Supports object-oriented programming (classes and objects)
•	Supports functions and async programming
PROGRAM:

// Simple Dart Program: Basic Syntax Example

import 'dart:io';

void main() {
  // Display a message
  print("Welcome to Dart Programming!");

  // Taking user input
  stdout.write("Enter your name: ");
  String? name = stdin.readLineSync();

  // Variables and data types
  int age = 20;
  double height = 5.9;
  bool isStudent = true;

  print("Hello, $name!");
  print("Age: $age");
  print("Height: $height feet");
  print("Student: $isStudent");

  // Simple calculation
  int a = 10, b = 5;
  int sum = a + b;
  print("Sum of $a and $b is $sum");
}

OUTPUT:

Welcome to Dart Programming!
Enter your name: Siva
Hello, Siva!
Age: 20
Height: 5.9 feet
Student: true
Sum of 10 and 5 is 15
